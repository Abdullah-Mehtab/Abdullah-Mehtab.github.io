Inside Look at Arbisoft’s Fresh Graduate Hiring Program</h3><p>Fresh graduates infuse the workforce with their boundless energy and enthusiasm each year. They come armed with an eagerness to learn and a determination to succeed in the &quot;<i>real world</i>.&quot; They tackle challenges head-on and with all their might, constantly seeking new solutions and asking questions to improve. </p><p>We at Arbisoft believe fresh graduates seamlessly integrate into any corporate culture and are open to new working methods. In this blog, we&#x27;ll take you through our fresh graduate hiring process and share insights on how we welcome new hires, and introduce you to some of our recent fresh graduate hires and their experiences with us.</p><h3>What does Fresh Graduate Hiring Look Like at Arbisoft?</h3><p>The Fresh Graduate Hiring program kicks off with the launch of registration at <a href="http://freshgradhiring.arbisoft.com"><u>freshgradhiring.arbisoft.com</u></a>. We also announce the dates on our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/arbisoft-career-culture/"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> profile, so make sure to follow Arbisoft Career &amp; Culture for all subsequent updates about the program. </p><p>As the registration process continues, our People Operations and Development (POD) team visits universities nationwide to inform students about our Fresh Graduate Hiring process and showcase Arbisoft&#x27;s culture. For Fresh Graduate Hiring 2023, we have visited nearly 30 universities throughout Pakistan, including universities in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CkqG6VoqmMr/"><u>Islamabad</u></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ClVsFhcKRTO/"><u>Karachi</u></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CloDLftqF7t/"><u>Faisalabad</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CmWYVcpqQjq/"><u>Lahore</u></a>. </p><p>But how does the entire Fresh Graduate Hiring process play out from registration to job offer?

Let’s take a closer look below. </p><h3>1. Register &amp; Practice</h3><p>The first step in the hiring process is for you to register for the Online MCQ test from <a href="http://freshgradhiring.arbisoft.com"><u>freshgradhiring.arbisoft.com</u></a><a href="https://freshgradhiring.arbisoft.com/our-process.html"><u>.</u></a> All BS/MS (CS, SE, IT, CE, EE) final-year students graduating between October 2022 - September 2023 are eligible to register for Arbisoft&#x27;s Fresh Grad Hiring 2023.</p><p>If you meet the eligibility criteria, visit the website and click on <b>Register Now</b> to apply. </p><p>You will receive two emails: a <i>registration confirmation</i> email and a <i>practice test </i>email that helps you prepare for the online MCQ exam.</p><p>To familiarize yourself with the format of the online MCQ test before registering, click on &quot;<b>Start Practicing</b>,&quot; and you will receive an email containing practice test materials.</p><p>It’s important to remember when filling out the registration form, you can select<i> Development</i>, <i>QA</i>, or <i>Both</i> as your areas of interest. We&#x27;ll share more detail on how these areas of interest impact the hiring process later on.</p><h3>2. Online MCQ Test</h3><p>If selected, you will then attempt the online MCQ test, which includes 30 multiple-choice questions. Here are some of the categories you might expect to see in the online MCQ exam:</p><ul><li><p>General Mental Ability</p></li><li><p>Data Structures</p></li><li><p>Programming</p></li><li><p>Algorithms</p></li><li><p>Operating Systems</p></li><li><p>Databases</p></li><li><p>Discrete Math
</p></li></ul><h3>3. Onsite Coding or BugBash Test</h3><p>Once you pass the online MCQ exam, you’ll sit through one of two types of tests in the next stage depending on the ‘area of interest’ you chose during the registration process. Here&#x27;s how each choice for the areas of interest affects the subsequent stages of the hiring process. 
</p><h4>A. Choosing &quot;<i>Development</i>&quot; as an Area of Interest</h4><p>If you select &quot;<i>development&quot;</i> only, you will take the coding exam in the next step. The coding test will evaluate your problem-solving capabilities if you want to pursue development as your career choice.</p><h4>B. Choosing &quot;<i>QA</i>&quot; as an Area of Interest</h4><p>If you select &quot;<i>QA&quot;</i> only, you will take the Bug Bash test in the next step. If you want to pursue QA, the Bug Bash test will evaluate your problem-solving and analytical skills.</p><h4>C. Choosing Both as an Area of Interest</h4><p>You also have an option of selecting “<i>both</i>” as an area of interest 
If you select both and pass the online MCQ test, you will take the coding test in the next step. You can choose between development and QA based on your coding test results before moving further in the process. </p><p>Some of the topics you’ll be tested on in the coding test are:
</p><ul><li><p>Problem-Solving</p></li><li><p>Data Structures</p></li><li><p>Algorithms</p></li><li><p>Design &amp; OOP</p></li><li><p>API Based</p></li></ul><h3>4. Interview &amp; Offer</h3><p>Our People Operations and Development team will contact you upon completing the coding/Bug Bash test to schedule the final stages of the hiring process, which include technical and HR interviews. </p><p>These interviews will take place between March and April and serve as the final step before extending a job offer. </p><p>During the technical interview, one of our technical team members will conduct a one-on-one conversation and evaluate your knowledge of fundamental technical concepts, learnings, and career goals. </p><p>The POD interview will be a conversation with our People Operations and Development team members about different topics.
</p><p>For more details on the process, please visit <a href="https://freshgradhiring.arbisoft.com/our-process.html"><u>https://freshgradhiring.arbisoft.com/our-process.html</u></a>.</p><h3>You’re Hired! Now What?</h3><p>Great news, you made it! You successfully completed each stage of the hiring process and now you’re a part of Arbisoft’s team. </p><p>But what can you expect on your first day? </p><h4>1. Getting to know the company</h4><p>Our People Operations Development (POD) team gets in touch with you as soon as you accept the job offer with details about your first day. Before you even arrive at the office, your official email addresses, Arbisoft ERP profiles, and Slack IDs are already set up. On the first day, the main event is the orientation presentation, where POD tells you everything you need to know about the company and its many facets. 
</p><h4>2. Planning out your day</h4><p>The first day is always a whirlwind of activity. How you spend it largely depends on the unique culture of the team you&#x27;ve joined. Some teams prefer to kick things off with a structured meet-and-greet session, allowing new members to get to know their colleagues. Others may opt for an expectation-setting meeting to set the tone for the days and weeks to come. Still, others may have entirely different activities planned for that first day. Regardless of the specifics, it&#x27;s sure to be a memorable one.
</p><h4>3. Arrange your office tour </h4><p>We&#x27;ll take you on a proper office tour, giving you a complete understanding of the building and its layout. You&#x27;ll not only get to see the meeting rooms, recreational areas, restrooms, and cafe, but we&#x27;ll also provide you with all the little details you&#x27;ll need to know, like where to get your morning coffee or how to reserve a conference room. This way, you&#x27;ll have all the necessary information to hit the ground running.</p><h4>4. Get acquainted with your mentor </h4><p>You&#x27;ll be paired with a mentor who will help you get up to speed quickly. They&#x27;ll have a customized training plan and will be responsible for assigning and evaluating tasks while providing regular feedback. This approach will ensure that you have the support and guidance you need to become a valuable long-term member of our organization. 
</p><h4>5. Prioritizing interaction </h4><p>Workplace interactions might be so brief that we never actually get to know the people we spend most days with. Every day, the company subsidizes lunch, with a different menu and special meals on special occasions, so that you have a consistent, safe space to socialize. 
</p><h4>6. Brief your tasks </h4><p>Most new hires are eager to get started. We assign you a task as per your training plans that you can perform swiftly and competently. We create an outline of your daily responsibilities to prepare you for work and provide a comprehensive overview of the projects you will work on, the people you will be collaborating with, and your significance to the project&#x27;s success.</p><h3>Exclusive Insider&#x27;s View</h3><p>Some of Arbisoft&#x27;s smartest engineers were selected through this program and have honed their craft with us over the years to now be in positions to lead teams, train others and help with the refinement of future iterations of the same program. </p><p>These are not ordinary engineers.
